# Experiment 11(e): Adjacency List Representation of a Graph

## Aim
To write a Python program to demonstrate the adjacency list representation of a given graph.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Create a Node Class**:
   - Define a class `AdjNode` to represent each node in the adjacency list:
     - Store the vertex number.
     - Store a reference to the next adjacent node.

2. **Graph Class**:
   - Define a class `Graph` to represent the graph using an adjacency list:
     - Initialize the number of vertices and create an array to store the adjacency lists.
   
3. **Add an Edge**:
   - Define a method `add_edge(src, dest)` to add an edge between two vertices:
     - Add `dest` to the adjacency list of `src`.
     - Add `src` to the adjacency list of `dest` (for undirected graphs).
   
4. **Print the Graph**:
   - Define a method `print_graph()` to print the graph:
     - Traverse each vertexâ€™s adjacency list and print the vertex along with its adjacent nodes.

5. **Main Program**:
   - Create a graph object with `V` vertices.
   - Add edges using the `add_edge()` method.
   - Print the adjacency list representation using `print_graph()`.

	graph.add_edge(1, 3)

## OUTPUT


![434655690-67685193-d1a0-4a97-9492-9839b295f0e8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35981810-f18a-4a39-830c-85ee3db69652)


## RESULT
The function successfully prints the adjacency list of the graph, displaying each node followed by its list of adjacent nodes.
